NL-SQL-Agent
NL-SQL-Agent is an interactive web application that serves as a natural language interface for data analysis. It allows users to upload a CSV file and query their data using plain English, which is then translated into executable SQL by a large language model.

‚ú® Features
Natural Language to SQL: Translate plain English questions into valid DuckDB SQL queries.

Dynamic Data Upload: Easily upload a CSV file to create a dynamic, in-memory database.

Real-time Results: Execute the generated SQL query and display the results in a clean, readable table.

Intuitive UI: A user-friendly, single-page web interface with a query history and a clean aesthetic.

Session Management: Maintain a persistent session for data and queries until the user clears it.

üíª Technologies
Backend:

Python 3.10+: The core programming language for the application.

Flask: A micro-framework for the backend web server.

DuckDB: A high-performance, in-process analytical database for fast data processing.

Groq API: Provides access to the large language model for natural language processing.

Gunicorn: A production-ready WSGI server for deployment.

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: A single, self-contained index.html file handles the entire user interface.
